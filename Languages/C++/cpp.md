## Basics

The minimal "hello world" C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    std::cout<<"Hello, World!\n";
    return 0;
}
```

The #include directive imports a library to be used. The main function is the entry point of the program and returns an integer upon successful completion.  
Blocks of code that perform some well defined action should be encapsulated on a function. That function would then be called on main(). A function must be declared before being used. The declaration follows this syntax:

```cpp
Node* next_node();     // Receives no argument, returns pointer to Node
void call_number(int); // Receives an int, returns nothing
double exp(double);    // Receives a double, returns a double.
```

There can be more than one argument. The types of the arguments and of the return are checked at compile time.  
The code that makes up a software must be comprehensible because this is the first step to maintainability. To make code more comprehensible, we must divide its tasks into functions. That way, we will have a basic vocabulary for data (types, both built-in and user defined) and for actions on that data (functions). Encapsulating a specific action into a function, forces us to not repeat ourselves (DRY) and to document that action's dependencies.  
If a function with the same name is declared with different arguments, the compiler will accept all of them and use the function corresponding to the type used. This allows us to change the behavior of an action based on the type of the data we are dealing with. Attention to the fact that the declarations cannot be ambiguous. If so, the compiler will throw an error. Another point is that if a set of functions have the same name, they should have the same semantics, i.e., they should perform the same action. Example:

```cpp
// This is called function overloading
void sum(int, int);
void sum(double, double);

void use()
{
  sum(2, 2);
  sum(2.7, 3.14);
}
```

Every object in the language has a type. An object is a portion of memory that holds a value of the given type. A value is a set of bits that are interpreted according to the type. Some built-in types are bool, char, int and double. Int variables' representation default to decimal (42) but can also be declared as binary (0b1010), hexadecimal (0x04AF) or octal (0432).  
The usual arithmetic, comparison, logical and modification operations are present:

| Arithmetic | Comparison | Logical  | Modification |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------- | ------------ |
| x + y      | x == y     | x && y   | x += y       |
| x - y      | x != y     | x \|\| y | x -= y       |
| x * y      | x < y      | !x       | ++x          |
| x / y      | x > y      |          | --x          |
| x % y      | x <= y     |          | x *= y       |
|            | x >= y     |          | x /= y       |
|            |            |          | x %= y       |

Attention to the fact that C++ makes implicit conversion on basic types:

```cpp
void my_function()
{
  double d = 3.14;
  int i = 5;
  d = d + i; // d is 8.14 here  
  i = d * i; // i is 15 here.
  // The resulting multiplication is 15.7,
  // but the value is truncated to fit an int
}
```

There are two forms of variable initialization, "=" or "{}":

```cpp
double d = 3.14;
double d2 {2.7};

// Vector of ints
vector<int> v {1, 2, 3};
```

The "=" is a tradition from C. "{}" is preferred because it avoids implicit conversions:

```cpp
int a = 4.8; // a is 4 here
int b {4.8}; // Error
```

If the data is coming from the user, for example, implicit conversions are a recipe for disaster, if not checked.  
The type of a variable can be deduced by the compiler with the "auto" keyword. My opinion is that auto should only be used when the types are very long (as they usually are with templates). Explicit (short) types help with code readability.

```cpp
auto a = 4.8;
auto b {4.8}; // Both a and b are double
```

-> 1.5

## User-Defined Types

## Modularity

## Classes

### Constructors

A constructor without parameters or with default parameters set is called a default constructor. It is a constructor which can be called without arguments:  

```cpp
class MyClass
{
  public:
    MyClass()
    {
      std::cout << "Default constructor invoked.\n";
    }
};

int main()
{
  MyClass o; // invoke a default constructor
}

// Default arguments
class MyClass
{
  public:
    MyClass(int x = 123, int y = 456)
    {
      std::cout << "Default constructor invoked.\n";
    }
};

int main()
{
  MyClass o; // invoke a default constructor
}

// If a default constructor is not explicitly defined in the code, the compiler will generate a default constructor.
// Constructors are invoked when object initialization takes place. They canâ€™t be invoked directly.
```

Member initializer list:

```cpp
class MyClass
{
 public:
   int x, y;
   MyClass(int xx, int yy)
     : x{ xx }
     , y{ yy } // member initializer list
   {
   }
};

int main()
{
   MyClass o{ 1, 2 }; // invoke a user-defined constructor
   std::cout << o.x << ' ' << o.y;
}
```

### Copy Constructors

When we initialize an object with another object of the same class, we invoke a copy constructor. If we do not supply our copy constructor, the compiler generates a default copy constructor.

```cpp
class MyClass
{
  private:
    int x, y;

  public:
    MyClass(int xx, int yy) : x{ xx }, y{ yy }
    {
    }
};
int main()
{
  MyClass o1{ 1, 2 };
  MyClass o2 = o1; // default copy constructor invoked
}
```

A user defined copy constructor has this signature: `MyClass(const MyClass& rhs)`

```cpp
class MyClass
{
  private:
    int x, y;

  public:
    MyClass(int xx, int yy) : x{ xx }, y{ yy }
    {
    }

    MyClass(const MyClass& rhs)
    : x { rhs.x }
    , y { rhs.y }
    {
    }
};
int main()
{
  MyClass o1{ 1, 2 };
  MyClass o2 = o1; // user copy constructor invoked
}
```

### Copy Assignment

When an object is created on one line and then assigned to in the next line, it then uses the copy assignment operator to copy the data from another object:

```cpp
MyClass from, to;
to = from; // copy assignment
```

A copy assignment operator is of the following signature: `MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& rhs)`

```cpp
class MyClass
{
  public:
    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& rhs)
    {
      // implement the copy logic here
      return *this;
    }
};

// The overloaded = operators must return a dereferenced this pointer at the end.
```

## Strings and Regex

To accept a string from standard input, use `std::getline(read_from, into)`:

```cpp
std::string s;
std::cout << "Enter string: ";
std::getline(std::cin, s);
```

To create a substring from a string, use the method `.substring(starting_index, length)`:

```cpp
std::string s = "Hello World";
std::string sub_s = s.substr(6, 5);
```

To find a substring in a given string, use the method `.find()`. If the method finds, it returns the position of the first found substring (the index of the first char of the substring). If the method doesn't find, it returns `std::string:npos`. The return type of the function is `std::string::size_type`:

```cpp
std::string s = "Hello World";
std::string search_for = "World";
std::string::size_type found = s.find(search_for);
```
